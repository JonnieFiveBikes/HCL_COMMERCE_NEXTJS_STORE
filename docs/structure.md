## presentation

- **components (core|custom)** - All the React components used for the store. Starting with the root "Page" component, which loads layouts and content items.
  - **blocks** - Smaller components used to build content components.
    - **(BlockComponentName)**
      - **index.tsx** - Primary component export with data usage methods and basic structural assembly of component parts.
      - **parts** - Directory for small components used within the parent content component only.
    - **styles** - Directory for all style override SxProps exports used within the parent component and its associated parts.
  - **content** - Content item components for building out each page. Components would include all content blocks that fit into a layout, such as Header, Footer, Cart, ProductGrid or page composer widgets.
    - **(ContentComponentName)**
      - **index.tsx** - Primary component export with data usage methods and basic structural assembly of component parts.
      - **parts** - Directory for small components used within the parent content component only.
    - **styles** - Directory for all style override SxProps exports used within the parent component and its associated parts.
  - **layouts** - Layouts are page scaffolding components for organizing component items. Standard component slots are header and footer, and other named slots based on a particular template.

Theme configuration files are lower case for top level configuration settings within the MUI theme and PascalCase for component style customization files / directories.
  - **(ComponentName)**
    - **index.ts** - Custom component styles and a loader for any variant and additive support being applied to the component.
    - **variants** - Contains custom variant definition files, named in camelCase with matching exports. Variants are mutually exclusive, only one being able to be set on a component through the variant prop.
  - **additives** - SX style groups, exported for use throughout the content componentsâ€™ sx attributes. Additives can also be used on parsed custom HTML, using the add html attribute, with a comma separated string of additive names.
- **utils (core|custom)** - Presentation utilities

## pages

Core route handlers for pages and api calls. Individual page routes should not be added here. They should be handled in the integration layer.

## public

Files inside public can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (/).
